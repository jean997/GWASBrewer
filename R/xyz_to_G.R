#'This function generates a matrix G of direct effects corresponding to a model in with variables Y, X, and Z_1, ..., Z_K.
#'There is a causal effect of X on Y given by gamma, which specifies the proportion of the variance of Y explained by X.
#'The K variables Z_1, ..., Z_K can have
#'effects to or from X and Y but do not have direct effects on each other. Vectors \code{dir_xz} and \code{dir_yz} specify the direction
#'of these effects with +1 corresponding to "to" effects and -1 corresponding to "from" effects. For example, \code{dir_xz = c(1, -1)}
#'and \code{dir_yz = c(1, 1)} would indicate two variables Z_1 and Z_2 with Z_1 being a common cause of both X and Y and Z_2
#'being a cause of $Y$ and caused by X (Z_2 is a mediator between X and Y). The function will give an error if there
#'is any index with \code{dir_xz} equal to -1 and \code{dir_yz} equal 1. This would indicate a variable that is a mediator between Y and
#'X, however, because there is an effect from X to Y assumed, the resulting graph would be cyclic and not allowed.
#'
#'The inputs `tau_xz` and `tau_yz` specify the effect sizes of each of the Z_k variables on or
#'from X and $Y$. These are given in signed percent variance explained. If we again used \code{dir_xz = c(1, -1)} and \code{dir_yz = c(1, 1)}
#' with \code{tau_xz = c(0.2, -0.3)} and \code{tau_yz = c(0.1, 0.25)},
#' this means that the confounder, Z_1 explains 20\% of the variance of X and 10\% of the
#'variance of Y and both effects are positive. X explains 30\% of the variance of the mediate Z_2 with a negative effect direction and
#'Z_2 explains 25\% of the variance of Y.
#'@return A matrix of direct effects corresponding to variables in the order (Y, X, Z_1, ..., Z_K)
