## Simulate Realistic GWAS Summary Statistics for One or Multiple Traits

The `simGWAS` package simulates GWAS summary statistics. The main function in the package is `sim_mv`. Get started with the "Simulating Data" vignette.

Briefly, `simGWAS` can simulate data with the following features.

- Data can be produced for continuous traits with user supplied linear causal relationships.
- GWAS for multiple traits may have overlapping samples. 
- Data can be generated with or without LD. One realistic LD pattern is supplied as built-in data.
- GWAS for the same trait can be replicated with different sample sizes, LD patterns, and allele frequencies (see the "Resampling and Re-Scaling.." vignette)

Data generated by `simGWAS` can be used for testing a variety of methods including heritability estimation,
Mendelian randomization, genetic correlation estimation etc.
The package also includes some utilities for LD-pruning and extracting LD matrices for simulated data. 

This package is under active development. Some features that may be added in the future include

- Support for binary traits
- Ability to add confounding effects

Note: This package is different from the `simGWAS` package that was previously on CRAN. This package will change names soon. 

## Installation

```
devtools::install_github("jean997/simGWAS",  build_vignettes = TRUE)
browseVignettes("simGWAS")
```

Note that the "Simulating Data" vignetted requires the following packages which will not be 
installed automatically:

+ DiagrammeR (use `install.packages`)

Generating individual level data using `resample_inddata` (see "Resampling and Rescaling..." vignette) requires the `hapsim` package which will not be installed automatically. This can be installed with 

```
install.packages("hapsim")
```
