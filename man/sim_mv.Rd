sim_mv(
  N,
  J,
  h2,
  pi,
  G = 0,
  est_s = FALSE,
  R_obs = NULL,
  R_E = NULL,
  R_LD = NULL,

\arguments{
\item{N}{GWAS sample size. N can be a scalar, vector, or matrix. If N is a scalar, all GWAS have the same sample size
and there is no overlap between studies. If N is a vector, each element of N specifies the sample size of the corresponding
GWAS and there is no overlap between studies. If N is a matrix, N_ii specifies the sample size of study i
and N_ij specifies the number of samples present in both study i and study j. The elements of N must be positive
but non-integer values will not generate an error.}

\item{J}{Number of variants to simulate}

\item{h2}{A scalar or vector giving the heritability of each trait.}

\item{pi}{A scalar or vector giving the expected proportion of direct effect SNPs for each trait.}

\item{G}{Matrix of direct effects. Rows correspond to the 'from' trait
and columns correspond to the 'to' trait, so \code{G[1,2]} is the direct effect of trait 1 on trait 2. G should have 0
on the diagonal.}

\item{est_s}{If TRUE, return estimates of se(`beta_hat`). If FALSE, the exact standard error of `beta_hat` is returned. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{R_obs}{Total observational correlation between traits. R_obs won't impact summary statistics unless there is sample overlap.
See Details for default behavior.}

\item{R_E}{Total correlation of the environmental components only. R_E and R_obs are alternative methods of specifying trait correlation.
Use only one of these two options.
R_E may be phased out in the future.}

\item{R_LD}{Optional list of LD blocks. R_LD should have class \code{list}.
Each element of R_LD can be either a) a matrix, b) a sparse matrix (class \code{dsCMatrix}) or c) an eigen decomposition (class \code{eigen}).
All elements should be correlation matrices, meaning that they have 1 on the diagonal and are positive definite. See Details and vignettes.}

\item{af}{Optional vector of allele frequencies. If R_LD is not supplied, af can be a scalar, vector or function.
If af is a function it should take a single argument (n) and return a vector of n allele frequencies (See Examples).
If R_LD is supplied, af must be a vector with length equal to the size of the supplied LD pattern (See Examples).}

\item{snp_effect_function}{Optional function to generate variant.
\code{snp_effect_function} can be a single function
or list of functions of length equal to the number of traits.}

\item{snp_info}{Optional \code{data.frame} of variant information to be passed to variant effect functions. If \code{R_LD} is
specified, \code{snp_info} should have number of rows equal to the size of the supplied LD pattern. Otherwise \code{snp_info}
should have \code{J} rows.}

\item{sporadic_pleiotropy}{Allow sporadic pleiotropy between traits. Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{pi_exact}{If TRUE, the number of direct effect SNPs for each trait will be exactly equal to `round(pi*J)`.}

\item{h2_exact}{If TRUE, the heritability of each trait will be exactly `h2`.}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements:

Simulated effect estimates and standard errors are contained in matrices

+ \code{beta_hat}: Effect estimates for each trait

+ \code{se_beta_hat} Standard error of effect estimates, equal to sqrt(1/N_m *Var(G_j)).

+ \code{s_estimate} Estimate of \code{se_beta_hat}. Present only if \code{est_s = TRUE}.

Four matrices contain direct and total marginal and joint SNP-trait associations:
+ \code{direct_SNP_effects_marg} and \code{direct_SNP_effects_joint} give direct effects of SNPs on traits. These are the
same if there is no LD. If there is LD, \code{direct_SNP_effects_marg} is the direct component of the expected marginal association.

+ \code{beta_marg} and \code{beta_joint} give the total SNP effects (direct and indirect). These are the
same if there is no LD. If there is LD, \code{beta_marg} is the total expected marginal association. i.e. \code{beta_marg} is the
expected value of \code{beta_hat}.

Four matrices describe the covariance of traits and the row correlation of effect estimates

+ \code{Sigma_G} Genetic variance-covariance matrix. Diagonal elements are equal to heritability.

+ \code{Sigma_E} Environmental variance-covariance matrix.

+ \code{trait_corr} Population correlation of traits. \code{trait_corr = Sigma_G + Sigma_E}.

+ \code{R} Row correlation of \code{beta_hat - beta_marg}, equal to \code{trait_corr} scaled by the overlap proportion matrix.

Finally,

+ \code{snp_info} Is a data frame with variant information. If \code{R_LD} was omitted, \code{snp_info} contains only the allele frequency of
each variant. If \code{R_LD} was included, \code{snp_info} also contains block and replicate information as well as any information supplied to the
\code{snp_info} input parameter.

\description{
Simulate multivariate GWAS data
}
\details{
This function generates GWAS summary statistics from a linear SEM specified by the matrix G.
The previous "xyz" mode is now deprecated. If you are used to using this function in xyz mode,
you can generate the corresponding G using the xyz_to_G function (see examples).

G should be square (#traits by #traits) matrix with 0s on the diagonal.
All traits have variance 1, so \code{G[i,j]^2} is the proportion of variance of trait j explained by the effect of trait i.
You will get an error if you specify a cyclic DAG, a DAG that is impossible, or a combination of \code{G} and \code{h2}
that is impossible.

To generate data with LD, supply \code{R_LD} which can be a list of matrices, sparse matrices, or eigen-decompositions.
These matrices are interpreted as blocks in a block-diagonal LD matrix. The \code{af} argument must be provided
and should be a vector with length equal to the total size of the LD pattern (the sum of the sizes of each block).
\code{R_LD} does not need to have the same size as \code{J}. The LD pattern will be repeated or subset as necessary
to generate the desired number of variants.

If \code{R_obs} is NULL (default value), we assume that direct environmental effects on each trait are independent and all
environmental correlation results from the relationships specified in \code{G}. Alternatively \code{R_obs} can be any positive
definite correlation matrix.
